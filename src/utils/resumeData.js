  aboutMe: "Hello and welcome to my page! I am a frontend developer in the Bay Area who's had 2 YOE as a frontend developer across various SF startups. I am currently working as a frontend developer at DockPad, an agile construction management startup in San Francisco. Throughout my roles, I have primarily built key components and features for end users using JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, HTML, CSS, Redux, Firebase, Node, Express, GraphQL, Jest, Enzyme, and REST APIs. I also helped contribute to scaling our frontend designs and build reusable, maintainable, and accessible features. Throughout my time at my previous work experiences, I have had many opportunities working with different engineers, managers, and clients. Building user-friendly products and improving upon front end designs has been an incredibly rewarding experience and I wish to continue to improve upon it in my career. ",
